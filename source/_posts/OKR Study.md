* [Common Mistakes](http://eleganthack.com/okr-mistakes-and-how-to-fix-them/):
  1. Too Many Per Quarter
  2. Set OKR for a week or a month: it would not be ambitious enough
  3. Set a metric driven objective: it's not inspirational
  4. Key results are tasks instead of results
  5. Don't set confidence level
  6. Don't track confidence level
